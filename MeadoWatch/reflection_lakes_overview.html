The hike can take anywhere from 4 to 8 hours depending on trail conditions, your plant identification experience and how fast you hike. <br /><br /><strong>How to Get There-Reflection Lakes:</strong>&nbsp;Once you are within Mt. Rainier National Park, follow the signs to Reflection Lakes/Ohanapecosh and park at the far Reflection Lakes parking lot (there are 2). Walk east along the road approximately 0.1 miles. Walk along the new granite and stoned lined sidewalk and look for signs to the Wonderland Trail. Proceed along the trail to the first plot and follow the directions in your pamphlet to the rest of the plots. Return the way you came on the trail and drive back down the mountain. Drop your data sheet on the brown metal box on the porch of L-112 (Employee Lounge) at Longmire. The Employee Lounge is directly behind the Wilderness Information Center.&nbsp;<br /><br />Below are maps of the Reflection Lakes plots for your reference.
